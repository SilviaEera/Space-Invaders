# Space-Invaders

Just download or clone the git repository. 
To run the Space Invader game you need to have pyhton installed to you system.
If you dont have python then simply download python from "https://www.python.org/downloads/"
After installing python install the pygame library crom command prompt (cmd) by writing "pip install pygame" or "pip3 install pygame".
Then you can run the main.py file from you command prompt or from your code editor(I've used PyCharm).
And there you have a Space Invader game.
Enjoy!
